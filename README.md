     npm install create-react-app
     
2. Start the back end server by first going to project's api folder:
     cd api
    
   then start the back-end server:
     nodemon server
     (The message "Database connected" should display in your terminal)
    
3. While the server is running, open a new terminal and run the following command to view the application running:
