     npm install create-react-app
     
2. Start the back end server by first going to project's api folder by writing 
     cd api
    
   Run the following command to start back-end server:
     nodemon server
     (You will get a message "Database connected" on the terminal)
    
3. While the server is running, open a new terminal and write the following command to view the project in browser:
